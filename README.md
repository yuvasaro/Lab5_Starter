## Part 3: Unit Testing with Jest
1. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because there could be lots of processes involved with sending a user's message to the recipient user that should be tested thoroughly together as a whole system.
2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application because checking the length of a message and comparing it to the maximum allowed length is a trivial task and can be done quickly in a small test.
